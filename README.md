# New-Programming-Language
- Under development
- On paper 
- working out the theory
- Will be used for anyone regardless of expeience
- This is my ultimate project
- Working on the abstract syntax trees
- This is going to be a unique language
- One of the goals is to put an end to C++
- Its going to work along side Python, and Ruby
- There is going to be a base
- There is a going to be a community 
- There is a difference betweeen complexity and simpicity
- Focus could be for competitive programming
- Testing, and more Testing
- Processes and Algorithms
- Testing, and more testing
- Adding ANTLR to the mix
- She is going to be used in Data Science alongside Python and Julia and Crystal
- There is got to be a better way
